Between travel and finishing up a couple of projects the past two semesters, I wasn't able to blog as much as I'd like. Rather than jumping straing into research after the holidays, it seemed like a nice time to blog about my favorite figure from the past semester. It was the striking image associated with [this paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005749), though I can't seem to find a link for it online, so here it is:

![](/img/striking_image_world_map.png "Hypothetical flu spreading visualization"){ width=100% }

To start go [here](https://openflights.org/data.html), to download an amazing open flight and airport dataset. Then you can read in the airport and flights data, and do some munging to get them in a clean format. For the specific files I used for this visualization see [this folder](https://github.com/sjfox/sjfox.github.io/tree/master/post/data/flights).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

airports <- read_csv("data/flights/airports.csv", 
                     col_names = c("id", "name", "city", "country", "iata", "icao", "lat", "long",
                                   "alt", "tz", "dst", "tz2", "type", "source"), na = c("\\N"))
flights <- read_csv("data/flights/routes.csv",
                    col_names = c("airline", "id", "src_airport", "src_airport_id", "dest_airport",
                                  "dest_airport_id", "codeshare", "stops", "equip"), na = c("\\N"))

airports <- airports %>% select(id, lat, long)
flights <- flights %>% select(src_airport_id, dest_airport_id) %>%
              filter(!is.na(src_airport_id) & !is.na(dest_airport_id))


```

So you can see now that `airports` now holds a database of airport locations with a unique identifier, and `flights` holds a database of flights from the year, with the unique identified for the source and destination airports.

```{r}
head(airports)
head(flights)

```

This next part is the hard part. We need to combine and clean the two datasets. To begin we do two joins, because we need the lat and long data for both the source and the destination airports. After that I create a new column that captures the source and destination airports, remove duplicates, and create a variable to loosely capture the flights to and from Europe (You'll see why at the end).

```{r}
clean_flights <- flights %>%  
  left_join(airports, by = c("src_airport_id" = "id")) %>%  
  rename(src_lat=lat, src_long=long) %>%  
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest_airport_id" = "id")) %>%  
  rename(dest_lat=lat, dest_long=long)  %>%  
  filter(src_airport_id != dest_airport_id)  %>%
  mutate(ordered_pair = if_else(src_airport_id > dest_airport_id,
                                paste0(dest_airport_id,src_airport_id),
                                paste0(src_airport_id,dest_airport_id))) %>%
  filter(!duplicated(ordered_pair)) %>%
  mutate(is_europe = if_else(dest_lat < 60 & dest_lat > 25 & src_lat < 60 & src_lat > 10 &
                             dest_long < 50 & dest_long > -15 & src_long < 50 & src_long > -15, TRUE,FALSE)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(is_europe))

```

Once you have that, you're basically done! Let's see what these flights looks like now! I couldn't believe how well `geom_curve()` did exactly what I wanted it to do.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
data <- map_data("world")

data %>% filter(`region` != "Antarctica") %>%
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
    geom_polygon(fill="black", color = "white", size=0.15) +
    geom_curve(data = clean_flights, aes(x = src_long, xend = dest_long,
                                         y = src_lat,  yend = dest_lat), 
                                         alpha=0.25, size=0.05,
                                         color = "white", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill="black"), legend.position="none") +
    coord_equal()
    

```

As you can see it's pretty difficult to see European countries, so here's the map if we change the size of the european flights, which I think looks nicer.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
data %>% filter(`region` != "Antarctica") %>%
  ggplot(aes(long, lat, group = group)) +
    geom_polygon(fill="black", color = "white", size=0.15) +
    geom_curve(data = clean_flights, aes(x = src_long, xend = dest_long,
                                         y = src_lat,  yend = dest_lat,
                                         size=is_europe), alpha=0.25,
                                         color = "white", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
    scale_size_manual(values = c(0.05, 0.01) ) +
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill="black"), legend.position="none") +
    coord_equal()

```

After that, I brought the image into inkscape, and added in the fake "flu spreading circles" with a lot of help from the maestro, [Anne Chambers](https://eannechambers.wordpress.com/).
